This project is a C compiler. It processes rudimentary C code into its MIPS equivalent. 
The allocated assignment time was 1 week, but I only had about 3 days to complete it. 
Therefore, this project is closer to a prototype than a complete program.
Functionality was prioritized over efficiency or abstraction / neatness.
